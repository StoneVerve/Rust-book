# Rust-book

Hello internet!


This repository main objetive is to keep track of all  the small projects (and not so small projects) that I'll develop using rust to learn rust :p 
Some of these projects will be the ones described in the excellent book known a as "The book" and others will come from my own mind :)

Hope someone can learn something new or interesting about rust from this projects

Cheers!
